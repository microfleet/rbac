# Typical Workflow

1. RBAC service is initialized in the microfleet system. It bootstraps with predefined roles
2. External services register their permissions in the system for easy lookup in the admin interface, but they are not
ultimately required to create roles, because roles are a set of ids for matching
3. rbac service provides package to be installed in the microfleet service, which syncs all lists of roles for that appropriate
service and is able to match incoming requests & roles locally, sync is performed via consul/etcd services with local agents
