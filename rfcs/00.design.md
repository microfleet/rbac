# RBAC design goals

RBAC service provides primitives for setting up permissions, roles, dynamic permission
lists registration

## Packages

### @microfleet/rbac-core

Contains persistence logic, data schema, CRUD operations
Basic primitives include `role` and `permission`

#### Schemas

Contains json schemas for input/output, as well as models

* [Role.json](../packages/rbac-core/schemas/Role.json)
* [Permission.json](../packages/rbac-core/schemas/Permission.json)

#### Operations

2 families of operations are available - `permissions` & `roles`

##### Permissions

Provides basic building blocks for roles to be created upon.
Permissions generally should not be deleted as roles rely heavily upon
their existence. Instead they should be deprecated. It is also important
to understand that there are reserved permissions which would work by default
on new services, which create new permission levels.

Generally permission is a string with the following semantics:

`<service-name>.<feature>[.<optional subfeature>].<type>`

Each of them in detail:

* `service-name` - unique service name across the system
* `feature` - granular routing prefix, for which the permission is applied
* `subfeature` - optional, could be multiple of them, for flexible granularity
* `type` - for wildcard permissions, could be anything, but generally expected to be one of:
  * `read`
  * `write`
  * `delete`

General convention:

* if `role` has access to `<service-name>` it can do everything
* `<service-name>.<feature>` - it can do everything on that feature (admin)
* `<service-name>.<feature>.read` - it can only read
* `<service-name>.<feature>.write` - it can create and update
* `<service-name>.<feature>.delete` - it can delete

That list can be structured for any business need, and commons, such as `read`, `write` & `delete` are
not obligatory to follow

###### permissions.register

Pass permission object to register or update it in the system. Generally services will be doing
that every time they startup. Update will be ignored if version in the system is higher that the
requested update

###### permissions.unregister

Discouraged to be called, but if some permission or service is no longer completely used in the system - can erase it

###### permissions.list

Returns list of permissions that can be used. Supports iteration via cursors

##### Roles
